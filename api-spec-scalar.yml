        Your routing policy defines how your transactions are routed.

        You can choose 1 of the 3 different schemes mentioned below for each
        asset type:
          - **None**; Defines the profile routing to no destination for that asset type. Incoming transactions to asset types routed to `None` will fail.
          - **Custom**; Route to an account that you choose. If you remove the account, incoming transactions will fail until you choose another one.
          - **Default**; Use the routing specified by the network profile the connection is connected to. This scheme is also referred to as "Profile Routing"

        Default Workspace Presets:

          **Note:** This API call is subject to Flexible Routing Schemes.

        Your routing policy defines how your transactions are routed.

        You can choose 1 of the 3 different schemes mentioned below for each
        asset type:
          - **None**; Defines the profile routing to no destination for that asset type. Incoming transactions to asset types routed to `None` will fail.
          - **Custom**; Route to an account that you choose. If you remove the account, incoming transactions will fail until you choose another one.
          - **Default**; Use the routing specified by the network profile the connection is connected to. This scheme is also referred to as "Profile Routing"

        Default Workspace Presets:
          - Network Profile Crypto → **Custom**
          - Network Profile FIAT → **None**
          - Network Connection Crypto → **Default**
          - Network Connection FIAT → **Default**

        >
          **Note**: By default, Custom routing scheme uses (`dstId` = `0`,
          `dstType` = `VAULT`).

        Facilitates the creation of a new token, supporting both EVM-based and
        Stellar/Ripple platforms. For EVM, it deploys the corresponding contract
        template to the blockchain and links the token to the workspace. For
        Stellar/Ripple, it links a newly created token directly to the workspace
        without deploying a contract. Returns the token link with status
        "PENDING" until the token is deployed or "SUCCESS" if no deployment is
        needed.

      description: >
        * `TRANSFER` - Transfers funds from one account to another. UTXO
        blockchains allow multi-input and multi-output transfers. All other
        blockchains allow transfers with one source address and one destination
        address.

        * `MINT` - Mints new tokens. Supported for Stellar, Ripple and EVM-based
        blockchains.

        * `BURN` - Burns tokens. Supported for Stellar, Ripple and EVM-based
        blockchains.

        * `CONTRACT_CALL` - Calls a smart contract method for web3 operations on
        any EVM blockchain. The Fireblocks [development
        libraries](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/ethereum-development#convenience-libraries)
        are recommended for building contract call transactions.

        * `TYPED_MESSAGE` - An off-chain message in either Ethereum Personal
        Message or EIP712 format. Use it to sign specific readable messages that
        are not actual transactions. [Learn more about typed
        messages](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/typed-message-signing-1).

        * `RAW` - An off-chain message with no predefined format. Use it to sign
        any message with your private key, including protocols such as
        blockchains and custom transaction types that are not natively supported
        by Fireblocks. [Learn more about raw signing
        transactions.](https://developers.fireblocks.com/docs/raw-signing)

        * `ENABLE_ASSET` - Algorand, DigitalBits, Solana, and Stellar require an
        on-chain transaction to create an asset wallet and enable the deposit
        address. This transaction is automatically created when adding assets on
        these blockchains at a vault account.

        * `STAKE` - Assign assets to a staking pool managed by a staking
        validator. Supported for Stellar and EVM-based blockchains. This
        transaction is automatically created when performing staking operations.

        * `UNSTAKE` - Remove assets from a staking pool managed by a staking
        validator. Supported for Stellar and EVM-based blockchains. This
        transaction is automatically created when performing staking operations.

        * `WITHDRAW` - Transfer assets from a dedicated staking vault account to
        another address. Supported for Stellar and EVM-based blockchains. This
        transaction is automatically created when performing staking operations.

            **Note:** Fireblocks will rename this type from `WITHDRAW` to a different type name soon. There will be a 7-day notice regarding the new type name.

        * `SUPPLY_TO_COMPOUND` - Deprecated since April 1st, 2023. Older
        transactions may have this as their operation, in case users in the
        workspace have used the direct integration between Fireblocks and the
        Compound DeFI protocol.

        * `REDEEM_FROM_COMPOUND` - Deprecated since April 1st, 2023. Older
        transactions may have this as their operation, in case users in the
        workspace have used the direct integration between Fireblocks and the
        Compound DeFI protocol.

        * `APPROVE` - Enables the approve function for a smart contract to withdraw from a designated wallet.

              specified by https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967[EIP1967], so
              that it doesn't conflict with the storage layout of the

                  nonempty, it's used as data in a delegate call to
                  `implementation`. This will typically be an encoded function
                  call, and allows initializing the storage of the proxy like a
                  Solidity constructor. Requirements: - If `data` is empty,
                  `msg.value` must be zero.

              This contract implements an upgradeable proxy. It is upgradeable
              because calls are delegated to an implementation address that can
              be changed. This address is stored in storage in the location
              specified by https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1967[EIP1967], so
              that it doesn't conflict with the storage layout of the
              implementation behind the proxy.
            errors:
              ERC1967NonPayable():
                - details: An upgrade function sees `msg.value > 0` that may be lost.

                  Initializes the upgradeable proxy with an initial
                  implementation specified by `implementation`. If `_data` is
                  nonempty, it's used as data in a delegate call to
                  `implementation`. This will typically be an encoded function
                  call, and allows initializing the storage of the proxy like a
                  Solidity constructor. Requirements: - If `data` is empty,
                  `msg.value` must be zero.

            API requests are authenticated by providing in each request:
              a. API Key in the `X-API-Key` header
              b. Auth header - `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` while the JWT is signed with an RSA 4096 private key.

            When creating a new API Key, you need to generate an RSA 4096
            private key and a CSR file. 

            The CSR file is uploaded to Fireblocks upon the user creation and
            used later on for signature validation (Auth JWT signature
            validation).
